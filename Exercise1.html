        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Abishek Gurung & I am a student. Currently I am studying my bachelors in Computer Science in Herald College. I am from Suryodaya, Ilam and I currently reside in Sathdobato, Lalitpur. I did my SLC in 2015 from Everland International Academy, Suryodaya & my +2 from United Academy, Lalitpur in 2018. And due to some reasons I had to take a gap from studies for 3 to 4 years about which I will explain later on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an enthusiastic person as I love to hike, swim, go on long runs & sports. I also like to learn new creative things.I joined Cornerstone Gurkha Training Center & started to train for the Army. And while I was training I stopped my studies.
